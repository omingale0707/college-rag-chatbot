SGPA is calculated as:

SGPA = Σ(Ci × Gi) / ΣCi

Where:
- Ci = Credit of the ith course
- Gi = Grade Point scored in the ith course
- i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n (number of courses in the semester)

#### Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)
CGPA is calculated as:

CGPA = Σ(Ci × Si) / ΣCi

Where:
- Si = SGPA of the ith semester
- Ci = Total credits in the ith semester
- i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n (number of semesters)
